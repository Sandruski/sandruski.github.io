intro: I am a game programmer and a gamer. I started playing video games when I was a kid, so they have been a huge part of my past. As I grew older I joined the video games industry, aiming to create experiences that would touch the future of other people like me. I have a lot of fun doing what I do!
outro: I mainly program in C/C++, but I am also familiar with languages such as C#, Python, and Java. I use Unity sometimes, but I have coded most of my games without any game engine.
